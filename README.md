# Final-Project

> Final-Project

The project utilizes React Router DOM for navigation and Redux for store management on the frontend. On the backend, there is an Express API with 
different endpoints and 3 Mongoose models for user, cart, and posters, all stored in a MongoDB database. Our posters are stored in a Google Cloud Bucket. We are deploying the frontend on Netlify and the backend on Google Cloud Run. 

One of the challenges was implementing a cart system that allows users to add items even if they are not logged in, and then connecting that cart to the user once they log in. Despite the challenges, we were able to successfully implement this feature.
